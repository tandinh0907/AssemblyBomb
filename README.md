# AssemblyBomb
This is a fun small assembly project I use to learn assembly by create and analyze the assembly code in `bomb-asm.txt` file in order to figure out what is the value of each level. There are 5 level in this bomb and you can try to defuse it by running the `disassemble.sh` file. Good luck!
